# EyeTrackingMouse
Replaces computer mouse with combination of [Tobii Eye Tracker 4C](https://gaming.tobii.com/tobii-eye-tracker-4c/) and hotkeys. 

This is MVP. Please help me to find bugs.
The app autoupdates using Squirrel.Windows.

# Installation
Download and run Setup.exe here https://github.com/Romex91/EyeTrackingMouse/releases/latest

This will create an entry in [Apps & features] and schedule the app to run at Windows startup.

The application requires elevated privilegies for controlling mouse when system windows are open.
